# TVSPlayerServer (deprecated)

New phase of TVSPlayer that splits existing project to Server/Client implementation. Right now It's far from a working state. 
 
## Planned improvements compared to existing stuff:
 - Multiplatform. It's written in .Net Core and UI is developed using Avalonia UI.
 - Multi user support. Basically data will be streamed through local network to possibly multiple client devices. Planned client platforms are Android, Windows and maybe iOS
 
## Disadvantages
 - More complicated configuration
 - In forseeable future probably worse server UI since I still need to learn Avalonia UI.
